# dm_control_walker_walk_training_app
This project is implemented to train the dm_control walker to walk. The soft actor critic (SAC) from tensorflow agents was chosen. The main.py could be directly executed on google colab after installing the tensorflow and dm_control libraries in the colab environment. Alternatively the dockerfile for containerizing the implementation could be used to deploy the training on google cloud virtual machines.
